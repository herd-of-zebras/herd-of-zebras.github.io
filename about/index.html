                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Herd of Zebras is a platform that helps to connect sports leagues, tournaments, and referees. It
                    provides an easy way for league owners/managers to source, manage, and pay referees in their leagues
                    and tournaments without any charge. On the other hand, it also helps referees with scheduling,
                    payment and reporting; as well as providing training for those who have not refereed before.</p>
                <p>Since its launch, Herd of Zebras has helped over 10 different sports with their league management
                    needs. Additionally, it allows convenient weekly payment options for referees so they can receive
                    payment on time every week. With this service, we hope to reduce the referee shortage crisis in
                    today's world.</p>
                <p>At Herd of Zebras our mission is to provide a reliable and efficient way to help leagues find
                    suitable referees quickly and easily. Not only that but also make sure that those individuals who
                    wish to referee get the required training needed at no cost. Join us today and help fight off the
                    referee shortage!</p>
