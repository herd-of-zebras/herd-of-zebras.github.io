        <strong>TERMS OF SERVICE - REFEREES</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Sports officiating opportunities provided by Herd of Zebras are coordinated on behalf of Augmented Reality Sports
        Management Corporation, a Colorado Corporation. Herd of Zebras contracts with sports referees and umpires to
        officiate games on behalf of our clients (sports leagues, tournaments and camps).</p>
    <p>All services are provided on a contract, at will status and are not eligible for benefits and do not meet the IRS
        requirements of “employed” workers. Herd of Zebras deducts a service fee, “commission” from all referee
        placements. This fee currently ranges from 5%, for existing referees already managed by a league, to 20%, for
        new referees which HOZ provides to leagues. These commissions may change at any time without notice. Officials
        accepting opportunities through Herd of Zebras, will receive notice of the compensation rate in advance of
        scheduled game(s) in the net amount of compensation.</p>
    <p>Herd of Zebras charges a $1.00 processing fee for each payment made to officials. This processing fee may change
        at any time without notice. Additional deductions of compensation may be made by Herd of Zebras following
        unsatisfactory performance of contracted officiating duties. These factors include but are not limited to:
        arriving late for scheduled games, failure to check in at the facility or checking in after a scheduled game
        start, failure to report game scores and required penalties, conflicts with league staff or players that result
        in an expulsion from the assigned facility, failure to provide required work ID and documentation requested for
        contracts.</p>
    <p>No minimum contract is required to use the services of Herd of Zebras. No cancellation fee is imposed for the
        suspension of services by either party.</p>
    <p>Certification of Request for Taxpayer identification Number and Certification:</p>
    <p>Under penalties of perjury, I certify that: 1. The number shown on this form is my correct taxpayer
        identification number (or I am waiting for a number to be issued to me); and 2. I am not subject to backup
        withholding because: (a) I am exempt from backup withholding, or (b) I have not been notified by the Internal
        Revenue Service (IRS) that I am subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or
        dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified me that I am no longer subject to backup withholding; and 3. I am a U.S.
        citizen or other U.S. person (defined below); and 4. I am of age 13 years or older; and 5. The FATCA code(s)
        entered on this form (if any) indicating that I am exempt from FATCA reporting is correct. Certification
        instructions. You must cross out item 2 above if you have been notified by the IRS that you are currently
        subject to backup withholding because you have failed to report all interest and dividends on your tax return.
        For real estate transactions, item 2 does not apply. For mortgage interest paid, acquisition or abandonment of
        secured property, cancellation of debt, contributions to an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), and
        generally, payments other than interest and dividends, you are not required to sign the certification, but you
        must provide your correct TIN. See the instructions for Part II, later.</p>
    <p>Herd of Zebras requires a background check (including local and federal sex offender registry) for all referees
        prior to service with any league.</p>
    <p>I acknowledge receipt of the DISCLOSURE REGARDING BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION and A SUMMARY OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE
        FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT as posted below and certify that I have read and understand both of those documents. I
        hereby authorize the obtaining of “consumer reports” and/or “investigative consumer reports” by [Employer]
        (“Employer”) at any time after receipt of this authorization and throughout my employment, if applicable.
        &nbsp;To this end, I hereby authorize, without reservation, any law enforcement agency, administrator, state or
        federal agency, institution, school or university (public or private), information service bureau, employer, or
        insurance company to furnish any and all background information requested by Background Screeners of America,

        and/or Employer. &nbsp;I agree that an, electronic or photographic copy of this Authorization shall be as valid
        as the original.</p>
    <p>NOTICE TO USERS OF CONSUMER REPORTS:</p>
    <p>OBLIGATIONS OF USERS UNDER THE FCRA</p>
    <p>The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681y, requires that this notice be provided to inform users
        of consumer reports of their legal obligations. State law may impose additional requirements. The text of the
        FCRA is set forth in full at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) website at
        www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. At the end of this document is a list of United States Code citations for the
        FCRA. Other information about user duties is also available at the CFPB’s website. Users must consult the
        relevant provisions of the FCRA for details about their obligations under the FCRA.</p>
    <p>The first section of this summary sets forth the responsibilities imposed by the FCRA on all users of consumer
        reports. The subsequent sections discuss the duties of users of reports that contain specific types of
        information, or that are used for certain purposes, and the legal consequences of violations. If you are a
        furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency (CRA), you have additional obligations and will receive
        a separate notice from the CRA describing your duties as a furnisher.</p>
    <p>I. OBLIGATIONS OF ALL USERS OF CONSUMER REPORTS</p>
    <p>A. Users Must Have a Permissible Purpose</p>
    <p>Congress has limited the use of consumer reports to protect consumers’ privacy. All users must have a permissible
        purpose under the FCRA to obtain a consumer report. Section 604 contains a list of the permissible purposes
        under the law. These are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As ordered by a court or a federal grand jury subpoena. Section 604(a)(1)</li>
        <li>As instructed by the consumer in writing. Section 604(a)(2)</li>
        <li>For the extension of credit as a result of an application from a consumer, or the review or collection of a
            consumer’s account. Section 604(a)(3)(A)</li>
        <li>For employment purposes, including hiring and promotion decisions, where the consumer has given written
            permission. Sections 604(a)(3)(B) and 604(b)</li>
        <li>For the underwriting of insurance as a result of an application from a consumer. Section 604(a)(3)(C)</li>
        <li>When there is a legitimate business need, in connection with a business transaction that is initiated by the
            consumer. Section 604(a)(3)(F)(i)</li>
        <li>To review a consumer’s account to determine whether the consumer continues to meet the terms of the account.
            Section 604(a)(3)(F)(ii)</li>
        <li>To determine a consumer’s eligibility for a license or other benefit granted by a governmental
            instrumentality required by law to consider an applicant’s financial responsibility or status. Section
            604(a)(3)(D)</li>
        <li>For use by a potential investor or servicer, or current insurer, in a valuation or assessment of the credit
            or prepayment risks associated with an existing credit obligation. Section 604(a)(3)(E)</li>
        <li>For use by state and local officials in connection with the determination of child support payments, or
            modifications and enforcement thereof. Sections 604(a)(4) and 604(a)(5) In addition, creditors and insurers
            may obtain certain consumer report information for the purpose of making “prescreened” unsolicited offers of
            credit or insurance. Section 604(c). The particular obligations of users of “prescreened” information are
            described in Section VII below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>B. Users Must Provide Certifications</p>
    <p>Section 604(f) prohibits any person from obtaining a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency (CRA)
        unless the person has certified to the CRA the permissible purpose(s) for which the report is being obtained and
        certifies that the report will not be used for any other purpose.</p>
    <p>C. Users Must Notify Consumers When Adverse Actions Are Taken</p>
    <p>The term “adverse action” is defined very broadly by Section 603. “Adverse actions” include all business, credit,
        and employment actions affecting consumers that can be considered to have a negative impact as defined by
        Section 603(k) of the FCRA – such as denying or canceling credit or insurance, or denying employment or
        promotion. No adverse action occurs in a credit transaction where the creditor makes a counteroffer that is
        accepted by the consumer.</p>
    <p>1. Adverse Actions Based on Information Obtained From a CRA</p>
    <p>If a user takes any type of adverse action as defined by the FCRA that is based at least in part on information
        contained in a consumer report, Section 615(a) requires the user to notify the consumer. The notification may be
        done in writing, orally, or by electronic means. It must include the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The name, address, and telephone number of the CRA (including a toll-free telephone number, if it is a
            nationwide CRA) that provided the report.</li>
        <li>A statement that the CRA did not make the adverse decision and is not able to explain why the decision was
            made.</li>
        <li>A statement setting forth the consumer’s right to obtain a free disclosure of the consumer’s file from the
            CRA if the consumer makes a request within 60 days.</li>
        <li>A statement setting forth the consumer’s right to dispute directly with the CRA the accuracy or completeness
            of any information provided by the CRA.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2. Adverse Actions Based on Information Obtained From Third Parties Who Are Not Consumer</p>
    <p>Reporting Agencies</p>
    <p>If a person denies (or increases the charge for) credit for personal, family, or household purposes based either
        wholly or partly upon information from a person other than a CRA, and the information is the type of consumer
        information covered by the FCRA, Section 615(b)(1) requires that the user clearly and accurately disclose to the
        consumer his or her right to be told the nature of the information that was relied upon if the consumer makes a
        written request within 60 days of notification. The user must provide the disclosure within a reasonable period
        of time following the consumer’s written request.</p>
    <p>3. Adverse Actions Based on Information Obtained From Affiliates</p>
    <p>If a person takes an adverse action involving insurance, employment, or a credit transaction initiated by the
        consumer, based on information of the type covered by the FCRA, and this information was obtained from an entity
        affiliated with the user of the information by common ownership or control, Section 615(b)(2) requires the user
        to notify the consumer of the adverse action. The notice must inform the consumer that he or she may obtain a
        disclosure of the nature of the information relied upon by making a written request within 60 days of receiving
        the adverse action notice. If the consumer makes such a request, the user must disclose the nature of the
        information not later than 30 days after receiving the request. If consumer report information is shared among
        affiliates and then used for an adverse action, the user must make an adverse action disclosure as set forth in
        I.C.1 above.</p>
    <p>D. Users Have Obligations When Fraud and Active Duty Military Alerts are in Files</p>
    <p>When a consumer has placed a fraud alert, including one relating to identify theft, or an active duty military
        alert with a nationwide consumer reporting agency as defined in Section 603(p) and resellers, Section 605A(h)
        imposes limitations on users of reports obtained from the consumer reporting agency in certain circumstances,
        including the establishment of a new credit plan and the issuance of additional credit cards. For initial fraud
        alerts and active duty alerts, the user must have reasonable policies and procedures in place to form a belief
        that the user knows the identity of the applicant or contact the consumer at a telephone number specified by the
        consumer; in the case of extended fraud alerts, the user must contact the consumer in accordance with the
        contact information provided in the consumer’ alert.</p>
    <p>E. Users Have Obligations When Notified of an Address Discrepancy</p>
    <p>Section 605(h) requires nationwide CRAs, as defined in Section 603(p), to notify users that request reports when
        the address for a consumer provided by the user in requesting the report is substantially different from the
        addresses in the consumer’s file. When this occurs, users must comply with regulations specifying the procedures
        to be followed. Federal regulations are available at www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.</p>
    <p>F. Users Have Obligations When Disposing of Records</p>
    <p>Section 628 requires that all users of consumer report information have in place procedures to properly dispose
        of records containing this information. Federal regulations are available at www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.
    </p>
    <p>II. CREDITORS MUST MAKE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES</p>
    <p>If a person uses a consumer report in connection with an application for, or a grant, extension, or provision of,
        credit to a consumer on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable terms
        available to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that person, based in whole or in part on a
        consumer report, the person must provide a risk-based pricing notice to theconsumer in accordance with
        regulations prescribed by the CFPB. Section 609(g) requires a disclosure by all persons that make or arrange
        loans secured by residential real property (one to four units) and that use credit scores. These persons must
        provide credit scores and other information about credit scores to applicants, including the disclosure set
        forth in Section 609(g)(1)(D) (“Notice to the Home Loan Applicant”).</p>
    <p>III. OBLIGATIONS OF USERS WHEN CONSUMER REPORTS ARE OBTAINED FOR</p>
    <p>EMPLOYMENT PURPOSES</p>
    <p>A. Employment Other Than in the Trucking Industry</p>
    <p>If the information from a CRA is used for employment purposes, the user has specific duties, which are set forth
        in Section 604(b) of the FCRA. The user must:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make a clear and conspicuous written disclosure to the consumer before the report is obtained, in a document
            that consists solely of the disclosure, that a consumer report may be obtained.</li>
        <li>Obtain from the consumer prior written authorization. Authorization to access reports during the term of
            employment may be obtained at the time of employment.</li>
        <li>Certify to the CRA that the above steps have been followed, that the information being obtained will not be
            used in violation of any federal or state equal opportunity law or regulation, and that, if any adverse
            action is to be taken based on the consumer report, a copy of the report and a summary of the consumer’s
            rights will be provided to the consumer.</li>
        <li>Before taking an adverse action, the user must provide a copy of the report to the consumer as well as the
            summary of consumer’s rights (The user should receive this summary from the CRA.) A Section 615(a) adverse
            action notice should be sent after the adverse action is taken. An adverse action notice also is required in
            employment situations if credit information (other than transactions and experience data) obtained from an
            affiliate is used to deny employment. Section 615(b)(2).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The procedures for investigative consumer reports and employee misconduct investigations are set forth below.</p>
    <p>B. Employment in the Trucking Industry</p>
    <p>Special rules apply for truck drivers where the only interaction between the consumer and the potential employer
        is by mail, telephone, or computer. In this case, the consumer may provide consent orally or electronically, and
        an adverse action may be made orally, in writing, or electronically. The consumer may obtain a copy of any
        report relied upon by the trucking company by contacting the company.</p>
    <p>IV. OBLIGATIONS WHEN INVESTIGATIVE CONSUMER REPORTS ARE USED</p>
    <p>Investigative consumer reports are a special type of consumer report in which information about a consumer’s
        character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living is obtained through personal
        interviews by an entity or person that is a consumer reporting agency. Consumers who are the subjects of such
        reports are given special rights under the FCRA. If a user intends to obtain an investigative consumer report,
        Section 606 requires the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The user must disclose to the consumer that an investigative consumer report may be obtained. This must be
            done in a written disclosure that is mailed, or otherwise delivered, to the consumer at some time before or
            not later than three days after the date on which the report was first requested. The disclosure must
            include a statement informing the consumer of his or her right to request additional disclosures of the
            nature and scope of the investigation as described below, and the summary of consumer rights required by
            Section 609 of the FCRA. (The summary of consumer rights will be provided by the CRA that conducts the
            investigation.)</li>
        <li>The user must certify to the CRA that the disclosures set forth above have been made and that the user will
            make the disclosure described below. </li>
        <li>Upon the written request of a consumer made within a reasonable period of time after the disclosures
            required above, the user must make a complete disclosure of the nature and scope of the investigation. This
            must be made in a written statement that is mailed or otherwise delivered, to the consumer no later than
            five days after the date on which the request was received from the consumer or the report was first
            requested, whichever is later in time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>V. SPECIAL PROCEDURES FOR EMPLOYEE INVESTIGATIONS</p>
    <p>Section 603(x) provides special procedures for investigations of suspected misconduct by an employee or for
        compliance with Federal, state or local laws and regulations or the rules of a self-regulatory organization, and
        compliance with written policies of the employer. These investigations are not treated as consumer reports so
        long as the employer or its agent complies with the procedures set forth in Section 603(x), and a summary
        describing the nature and scope of the inquiry is made to the employee if an adverse action is taken based on
        the investigation. Notice to Users of Consumer Reports – Rev. Eff. January 1, 2013 Page 5 of 6</p>
    <p>VI. OBLIGATIONS OF USERS OF MEDICAL INFORMATION</p>
    <p>Section 604(g) limits the use of medical information obtained from consumer reporting agencies (other than
        payment information that appears in a coded form that does not identify the medical provider). If the
        information is to be used for an insurance transaction, the consumer must give consent to the user of the report
        or the information must be coded. If the report is to be used for employment purposes – or in connection with a
        credit transaction (except as provided in regulations) the consumer must provide specific written consent and
        the medical information must be relevant. Any user who receives medical information shall not disclose the
        information to any other person (except where necessary to carry out the purpose for which the information was
        disclosed, or a permitted by statute, regulation, or order).</p>
    <p>VII. OBLIGATIONS OF USERS OF “PRESCREENED” LISTS</p>
    <p>The FCRA permits creditors and insurers to obtain limited consumer report information for use in connection with
        unsolicited offers of credit or insurance under certain circumstances. Sections 603(1), 604(c), 604(e), and
        615(d). This practice is known as “prescreening” and typically involves obtaining from a CRA a list of consumers
        who meet certain pre-established criteria. If any person intends to use prescreened lists, that person must (1)
        before the offer is made, establish the criteria that will be relied upon to make the offer and to grant credit
        or insurance, and (2) maintain such criteria on file for a three year period beginning on the date on which the
        offer is made to each consumer. In addition, any user must provide with each written solicitation a clear and
        conspicuous statement that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information contained in a consumer’s CRA file was used in connection with the transaction.</li>
        <li>The consumer received the offer because he or she satisfied the criteria for credit worthiness or
            insurability used to screen for the offer.</li>
        <li>Credit or insurance may not be extended if, after the consumer responds, it is determined that the consumer
            does not meet the criteria used for screening or any applicable criteria bearing on credit worthiness or
            insurability, or the consumer does not furnish required collateral.</li>
        <li>The consumer may prohibit the use of information in his or her file in connection with future prescreened
            offers of credit or insurance by contacting the notification system established by the CRA that provided the
            report. The statement must include the address and toll-free telephone number of the appropriate
            notification system. In addition, the CFPB has established the format, type size, and manner of the
            disclosure required by Section 615(d), with which users must comply. The relevant regulation is 12 CFR
            1022.54.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>VIII. OBLIGATIONS OF RESELLERS</p>
    <p>A. Disclosure and Certification Requirements</p>
    <p>Section 607(e) requires any person who obtains a consumer report for resale to take the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Disclose the identity of the end-user to the source CRA.</li>
        <li>Identify to the source CRA each permissible purpose for which the report will be furnished to the end-user.
        </li>
        <li>Establish and follow reasonable procedures to ensure that reports are resold only for permissible purposes,
            including procedures to obtain: (1) the identify of all end-users; (2) certifications from all users of each
            purpose for which reports will be used; and (3) certifications that reports will not be used for any purpose
            other than the purpose(s) specified to the reseller. Resellers must make reasonable efforts to verify this
            information before selling the report.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>B. Reinvestigations by Resellers</p>
    <p>Under Section 611(f), if a consumer disputes the accuracy or completeness of information in a report prepared by
        a reseller, the reseller must determine whether this is a result of an action or omission on its part and, if
        so, correct or delete the information. If not, the reseller must send the dispute to the source CRA for
        reinvestigation. When any CRA notifies the reseller of the results of an investigation, the reseller must
        immediately convey the information to the consumer.</p>
    <p>C. Fraud Alerts and Resellers</p>
    <p>Section 605A(f) requires resellers who receive fraud alerts or active duty alerts from another consumer reporting
        agency to include these in their reports.</p>
    <p>IX. LIABILITY FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FCRA</p>
    <p>Failure to comply with the FCRA can result in state government or federal government enforcement actions, as well
        as private lawsuits. Sections 616, 617, and 621. In addition, any person who knowingly and willfully obtains a
        consumer report under false pretenses may face criminal prosecution. Section 619.</p>
